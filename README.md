# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1.0 Building Character

A personal development repository designed to host the foundational files, frameworks, and logic layers necessary for building character IRL (In Real Life). This project treats personal growth as a modular, versioned system‚Äîstructured, intentional, and always evolving.

---

## üå± What Is This Project?

**1.0 Building Character** is a codespace for tracking and engineering the traits, habits, and systems that shape who I am becoming. It‚Äôs a living framework for intentional growth, built with the same care and clarity as any software project.

---

## üß† Why Treat Character Like Code?

- **Version Control**: Growth is iterative‚Äîtrack changes, reflect, and refine.
- **Modularity**: Each trait, habit, or system is a module that can be improved or replaced.
- **Logic-Layering**: Embed feedback loops, scoring systems, and temporal logic to guide development.
- **Transparency**: Document the journey for clarity, accountability, and future reference.
